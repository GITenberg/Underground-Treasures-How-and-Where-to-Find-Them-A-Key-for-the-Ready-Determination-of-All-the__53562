MINERALS IN THE UNITED STATES&mdash;OBJECT OF THIS WORK AND HOW TO USE
IT&mdash;THE BEST MINERAL REGIONS.</p></div>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">M</span>INERALS head the list of the sources of our nation’s wealth. Gold,
iron, coal and marble have not only contributed largely to the
enterprise and opulence of America, but at this very moment they exert a
commanding influence in political circles. No one can prophesy the
greatness of the commercial power which is sure to rise on their
foundations.</p>

<p>No other country can boast of such<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_010" id="page_010"></a>{10}</span> vast and valuable mineral deposits.
Yet our country is not half developed. Treasures lie undiscovered in our
mountains and under our farms,&mdash;gems of “purest ray serene” and still
more precious metals. Some will be accidentally brought to light; but
the majority are so disguised that their real nature is not seen. How
unpromising are the best ores of iron, zinc and silver and the rarest
gems! Then, again, there is “mimicry” in the mineral kingdom; worthless
stones are often good imitations of the valuable, and fortunes have been
sunk in mining pyrites for gold, mica for silver and slate for coal. But
if we wait for mineralogists to develop our mineral resources, we must
wait a millenium, our country is so vast and scientific laborers so few.
Fortunately, however, nature has stamped upon each mineral some peculiar
feature or assemblage of characters which enable any one with average
common sense to distinguish those which are of value in the arts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_011" id="page_011"></a>{11}</span></p>

<p>The object of this work is to point out those distinctions so clearly
and in popular language that those who do not claim to be scientific may
determine specimens for themselves; in other words, to furnish <i>a key
for the ready determination of all the useful minerals within the United
States</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Two hundred and forty-four mineral species have been found within the
bounds of the Union. Of these only one-third are of any use to the
practical man. These eighty have certain general characters in common,
but always some specific differences. The object is to divide them into
groups, as the botanist divides the plants, and then to separate the
individuals by some properties or features peculiar to each. Only those
minerals are mentioned which are useful: any specimen, therefore, which
does not fit any of the descriptions given, may be considered of no
special<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_012" id="page_012"></a>{12}</span> value. By the term “color,” is meant the color of a fresh
fracture, for the exposed surface often misrepresents the true aspect.
Exact color is not meant, but “red” stands for reddish, “yellow” for
yellowish, “white” for a light gray up to the perfectly transparent.
“Magnetic” means that the specimen disturbs the needle of a compass, or
that a magnet will take up fine particles. A mineral is “opaque” if the
light will not pass through either the edges or a thin fragment. A
“translucent” mineral is either clear as crystal or only allows light to
pass dimly through a thin portion. “Effervescence” is the bubbling
produced by the escape of a gas, as in soda-water. “Gravity” is the
weight compared with that of an equal bulk of water. In the majority of
cases the specimen can be determined without it; but there may be
several doubtful cases which can be settled only by obtaining the
gravity. This is done by first weighing a fragment of the mineral in a
small apothecary<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_013" id="page_013"></a>{13}</span> or jeweler’s balance, reckoning it in grains. Then by
a thread suspend it below one of the scales in a tumbler of water,
taking care that the specimen is covered with water and does not touch
the sides. Subtract the weight in grains as it hangs in the water from
the first weight, and divide the first weight by the difference: the
result is the gravity. Five per cent. should be allowed for impurities.
Where exactness is not required, the gravity of a specimen may be judged
by comparing it with well-known substances. Thus,</p>

</table>

<p>If the gravity of a mineral is 1.5, a cubic inch of it will weigh about
¾ ounce; if 2., 1 oz.; if 2.5, 1¼ oz.; if 3., 1½ oz.; if 4., 2 oz.; if
5, 2½ oz., etc.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_014" id="page_014"></a>{14}</span></p>

<p>There is no section of our country that may not reward a diligent search
for precious or useful minerals. The rocks, however, between the
Alleghanies and the Atlantic and between the Rocky Mountains and the
Pacific furnish the greater variety and abundance. Here are found the
best ores. Gold and silver seem to abound more on the western than
eastern sides of both mountain-chains. A trap-region, like the shore of
Lake Superior and the Connecticut River Valley, is likely to be a good
locality for copper and iron. The Mississippi Valley, or the region of
Bituminous Coal, furnishes chiefly iron and lead; gold, silver and
copper are seldom found. In general, where the layers of rock lie level
and contain fossil shells, it is a locality good only for soft coal,
(New York excepted), iron ore, gypsum and salt. The regions of granite,
slate, limestone, marble, etc., offer the greatest inducement to search
for useful minerals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_015" id="page_015"></a>{15}</span></p>

group B. Next notice whether the light will shine through it: if it does
not pass through even the edges or a thin splinter, it is opaque; if any
light is allowed to pass, it is translucent. With a knife see if it is
harder or softer than pure white marble; then, noting its color, compare
it with the descriptions of minerals referred to by the numbers. If it
agree<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_016" id="page_016"></a>{16}</span> with none, it may be considered of no use in the arts. To make
doubly sure, get the gravity as described on page 12.</p>

<p><i>Examples</i>: Suppose we have an unknown mineral in hand. We first try to
scratch glass with it and find it impossible. It therefore belongs to
section B. Next we find it is opaque and yellow, and evidently heavier
and harder than marble. It must be one of two: 44 attracts the
compass-needle, and this will not; it is consequently 26 or <i>Copper
Pyrites</i>, if it agree with the description. If not, it is something of
no great value.</p>

<p>You have found what you think is a diamond, Does the specimen scratch
glass? Yes, easily, and is brittle. Can you see through it? You say it
is clear as glass. Look now under section A, “translucent” series,
number 6 (for it is colorless), and decide which of the four it is. The
first one (27), is diamond; but do not let your wishes <i>make</i> it agree.
Turning to the description, you read that it can not be scratched with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_017" id="page_017"></a>{17}</span>
a file or worn down on a grindstone. This decides against it. Besides,
the gravity (2.5) is too little. With the next (57) it agrees perfectly,
and you need not go further. Should the specimen, however, agree very
well with rock crystal, only that its gravity (3.5) is too great, then
it is topaz.</p>

<p><big><big><big>☞</big></big></big> All minerals that scratch glass are brittle, and all (save 32 and
46) are infusible or melt with great difficulty.</p>

<p><big><big><big>☞</big></big></big> The following minerals will burn, evaporate or melt without a flux
in an ordinary fire: Nos. 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 21, 23,
24, 26, 29, 33, 35, 37, 44, 53, 55, 62, 63, 70, 71, 75. All but the
following are heavier than marble: 2, 4, 6, 7, 10, 14, 16, 34, 36, 40,
47, 48, 56, 60, 61, 69, 71. Nos. 2, 50 and 58 alone dissolve in water.</p>

<p><big><big><big>☞</big></big></big> In determining color, be sure you have a fresh surface, for the
outside is often deceptive. By “blow-pipe” is meant the tapering tube
used by watch-makers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_018" id="page_018"></a>{18}</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>MINERAL RICHES, HOW DISCOVERED&mdash;INDICATIONS&mdash;SEARCHING FOR
DIAMONDS, AND HOW TO DISTINGUISH THEM&mdash;PAYING LOCALITIES OF
GOLD&mdash;“FOOL’S GOLD”&mdash;PROSPECTING FOR SILVER AND COPPER&mdash;WHERE TO
LOOK FOR LEAD AND IRON.</p></div>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">T</span>HE mineral riches of a country are frequently discovered by attentively
observing the fragments brought down by the action of water from the
hills into the valleys; and on tracing these to their several sources,
the veins from which they were originally detached, are in many
instances found. Water also acts in another way a very important part in
the discovery of mineral veins, as by closely examining the faces of the
different gullies and ravines, which intersect a country, a ready means
is afforded of ascertaining whether its strata<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_082" id="page_082"></a>{82}</span> are traversed by
metalliferous deposits; and, therefore, in exploring with a view to its
mineral productions, no opportunity should be lost of observing the
various sections thus naturally laid bare.</p>

<p>When fragments of an ore are found on a hill-side, it is very evident
that the vein must lie higher up. If the vein is horizontal and the
fragments are found on the top of the hill, there is no probability of
finding much if any of the vein, for generally it has been washed away.
Ore-veins, however, are almost always nearly vertical; so that boring is
of little use, as it might pass by the richest vein, or, striking it
lengthwise, give a too favorable result.</p>

<p>As heavy minerals do not drift far, metals are always found near their
source.</p>

<p>Horizontal beds can be worked at the least cost.</p>

<p>Pockets and nodules, or any detached masses of minerals, are soon
exhausted. Veins, lodes and beds are most valuable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_083" id="page_083"></a>{83}</span></p>

<p>Boring a three-inch hole, which costs about $1 a foot, is a good method
of testing a mineral vein or bed which lies more or less horizontally. A
shaft may be sunk in sandstone for from $6 to $3 per cubic yard; in
slate and gravel, at from $2 to $1.</p>

<p>The existence of mineral springs, and the rapid melting of the snow in
any locality, are no indications of ores.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Searching for Diamonds.</span>&mdash;Few things are so unpromising and unattractive
as gems in their native state. Hence their slow discovery. There is
little doubt that diamonds exist in many places as yet unknown, or where
their presence is unsuspected. It is very difficult for the unpracticed
eye to distinguish them from crystals of quartz or topaz. The color
constitutes the main difficulty in detecting their presence. They are of
various shades of yellowish brown, green, blue and rose-red, and thus
closely resemble the common gravel by which they are surrounded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_084" id="page_084"></a>{84}</span> Often
they are not unlike a lump of gum arabic, neither brilliant nor
transparent. The finest, however, are colorless, and appear like
rock-crystals.</p>

<p>In Brazil, where great numbers of diamonds, chiefly of small size, have
been discovered, the method of searching for them is to wash the sand of
certain rivers in a manner precisely similar to that employed in the
gold fields, namely, by prospecting pans. A shovelful of earth is thrown
into the pan, which is then immersed in water, and gently moved about.
As the washing goes on, the pebbles, dirt and sand are removed, and the
pan then contains about a pint of thin mud. Great caution is now
observed, and ultimately there remains only a small quantity of sand.
The diamonds and particles of gold, if present, sink to the bottom,
being heavier, and are selected and removed by the practiced fingers of
the operator. But how shall the gems be detected by one who has had no
experience, and who in a jeweler<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_085" id="page_085"></a>{85}</span>’s shop could not separate them from
quartz or French paste? The difficulty can only be overcome by testing
such stones as may be suspected to be precious. Let these be tried by
the very sure operation of attempting to cut with their sharp corners
glass, crystal or quartz. When too minute to be held between the finger
and thumb, the specimens may be pressed into the end of a stick of hard
wood and run along the surface of window glass. A diamond will make its
mark, and cause, too, a ready fracture in the line over which it has
traveled. It will also easily scratch rock-crystal, as no other crystal
will.</p>

<p>But a more certain and peculiar characteristic of the diamond lies in
the form of its crystals. The ruby and topaz will scratch quartz, but no
mineral which will scratch quartz has the <i>curved edges</i> of the diamond.
In small crystals this peculiarity can be seen only by means of a
magnifying glass; but it is invariably present.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_086" id="page_086"></a>{86}</span> Interrupted, convex or
rounded angles, are sure indications of genuineness. Quartz crystal is
surrounded by six faces; the diamond by four. The diamond breaks with
difficulty; and hence a test sometimes used is to place the specimen
between two hard bodies, as a couple of coins, and force them together
with the hands. Such a pressure will crush a particle of quartz, but the
diamond will only indent the metal.</p>

<p>The value of the diamond is estimated by the carat, which is equal to
about four grains, and the value increases rapidly with its weight. If a
small, rough diamond weigh four grains, its value is about $10; if eight
grains, $40; if sixteen grains, $640. A cut diamond of one carat is
worth from $50 to $100.</p>

<p>The imperfections of the diamond, and, in fact, of all cut gems, are
made visible by putting them into oil of cassia, when the slightest flaw
will be seen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_087" id="page_087"></a>{87}</span></p>

<p>A diamond weighing ten carats is “princely;” but not one in ten thousand
weighs so much.</p>

<p>If a rough diamond resemble a drop of clear spring water, in the middle
of which you perceive a strong light; or if it has a rough coat, so that
you can hardly see through it, but white, and as if made rough by art,
yet clear of flaws or veins; or, if the coat be smooth and bright, with
a tincture of green in it,&mdash;it is a good stone. If it has a milky cast,
or a yellowish-green coat, beware of it. Rough diamonds with a greenish
crust are the most limpid when cut.</p>

<p>Diamonds are found in loose pebbly earth, along with gold, a little way
below the surface, towards the lower outlet of broad valleys, rather
than upon the ridges of the adjoining hills.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Searching for Gold.</span>&mdash;The paying localities of gold deposits are the
slopes of the Rocky and Alleghany Mountains. Gold need not be looked for
in the anthracite<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_088" id="page_088"></a>{88}</span> and bituminous coal-fields nor in limestone rock. It
is seldom found in the beds of rivers. The thing itself is the surest
indication of its existence. If soil or sand is “washed” as described in
Chapter V., and the particles of gold are not heavy enough to remain at
the bottom but float away, the bed will not pay.</p>

<p>Along streams rather high up among the mountains, and in the gravelly
drift covering the slopes of the valley below, are the best prospects.
Where the stream meets an obstacle in its path or makes a bend or has
deep holes, there we may look for “pockets” of gold. Black or red sands
are usually richest. Gold-bearing rock is a slate or granite abounding
in rusty looking quartz veins, the latter containing iron pyrites or
cavities. Almost all iron pyrites and silver ores, may be worked for
gold. When the quartz veins are thin and numerous rather than massive,
and lie near the surface, they are considered most profitable. Few veins
can be worked with<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_089" id="page_089"></a>{89}</span> profit very far down. As traces of gold may be found
almost everywhere, no one should indulge in speculation before
calculating the percentage and the cost of extraction. Gold-hunting,
after all, is a lottery with more blanks than prizes.</p>

<p>The substances most frequently mistaken for gold are <i>iron pyrites</i>,
<i>copper pyrites</i> and <i>mica</i>. The precious metal is easily distinguished
from these by its malleability (flattening under the hammer) and its
great weight, sinking rapidly in water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Searching for Silver.</span>&mdash;This metal is usually found with lead ore and
native copper. Slates and sandstones intersected by igneous rocks as
trap and porphyry, are good localities. Pure silver is often found in or
near iron ores and the dark brown zinc blende. The Colorado silver lodes
are porous at the surface and colored more or less red or green. Any
rock suspected of containing silver should be powdered and dissolved in
nitric acid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_090" id="page_090"></a>{90}</span> Pour off the liquid and add to it a solution of salt. If a
white powder falls to the bottom which upon exposure turns black, there
is silver in it. Silver mines increase in value as in depth, whereas
gold diminishes as we descend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Searching for Copper.</span>&mdash;The copper ores, after exposure, or after being
dipped in vinegar, are almost invariably green on the surface. They are
most abundant near trap dykes. The pyrites is generally found in lead
mines, and in granite and clay-slate. Copper very rarely occurs in the
new formations, as along the Atlantic and Gulf borders, and in the
Mississippi Valley south of Cairo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Searching for Lead.</span>&mdash;Lead is seldom discovered in the surface soil. It
is also in vain to look for it in the coal region and along the coast.
It must be sought in steep hills, in limestone and slate rocks. A
surface cut by frequent ravines or covered by vegetation in lines,
indicates mineral crevices. The galena from the slate<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_091" id="page_091"></a>{91}</span> is said to
contain more silver than that from the limestone. The purest specimens
of galena are poorest in silver; the small veins are richest in the more
precious metal. A lead vein is thickest in limestone, thinner in
sandstone and thinnest in slate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Searching for Iron.</span>&mdash;Any heavy mineral of a black, brown, red or yellow
color may be suspected to be iron. To prove it, dissolve some in oil of
vitriol and pour in an infusion of nut-gall or oak-bark; if it turns
black, iron is present. If a ton of rich magnetic ore costs more than $4
at the furnace, good hematite more than $3, and poor ores more than
$1.50 or $2, they are too expensive to pay, unless iron is unusually
high. Deep mining for iron is not profitable. Generally speaking, a bed
of good iron ore, a foot thick, will repay the cost of stripping it of
soil, etc., twelve feet thick. Red and yellow earths, called ochres,
contain iron. Magnetic ore is easily found by a compass.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_092" id="page_092"></a>{92}</span></p>

<p>That is, an ore of iron which contains less than 25 per cent. of metal
will not pay for working; for the reduction of iron in comparison with
copper ore is very difficult. Gold is very easily extracted, and hence
some quartz rocks which do not apparently contain a particle of gold,
pay<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_094" id="page_094"></a>{94}</span> well, a bushel of rock often yielding half an ounce.</p>

<p>Iron occurs in large masses or beds; but the other metals are scattered
in fragments through sand or soil, or exist in veins running through
rocks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Washing for Gold and Platinum.</span>&mdash;This operation, called “panning,” is the
oldest and simplest method of extracting the precious metals. At the
present time, it furnishes to Russia nearly all the gold produced in
that empire. It is based on the principle that substances of different
weights may be separated by means of water,&mdash;the heaviest going to the
bottom first. To examine the bank or bed of a river, suspected to
contain gold, fill a milk-pan with the sands and carry it to a tub or
pool of quiet water. Dip it under, stirring the mass with one hand or a
stick. Then pour off the muddy water, fill with fresh water stirring
again, and again pour off the light sand, clay, etc. Scales of gold will
sink fast; mica flakes will take their time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_095" id="page_095"></a>{95}</span> Repeat this process till
all the fine particles are washed off; then allow just enough water to
enter the pan as will cover the sand. By shaking the pan and gradually
lowering the side by which it is held, the light sand will flow off,
leaving in the corner a heap of coarse sand. Put in a small quantity of
water and turn the pan around so as to create a gentle current, when the
precious metal, if there be any, can be easily detected,&mdash;the gold by
its bright lustre, the platinum by its lead color, and both by their
malleability. Particles of gold are of uniform color and are either flat
or rounded; while other yellow grains are angular. Holding the pan in
the sunshine, secure any glittering glassy crystals, and test them for
diamonds or rock-crystals. A magnet will remove any particles of
magnetic iron-ore.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Assay of Gold Ore.</span>&mdash;Gold may be found in quartz rock, in iron and copper
pyrites, and in silver ores.</p>

<p>To ascertain if any gold is present in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_096" id="page_096"></a>{96}</span> quartz, reduce the rock to
powder and sift it. A certain quantity, say half a peck, is then washed
as above described, till a manageable quantity of sand is left. If there
is any show of gold, dry the mass and put it in a bowl or glass dish,
and add an ounce of quicksilver, stirring the mixture well with a wooden
rod. The quicksilver, which will unite with every particle of gold which
may be there, is then poured off into a soft leather (chamois) bag. This
is squeezed to remove superfluous quicksilver, and a pasty amalgam is
left, which is put into an iron vessel and heated red hot. The yellow
powder remaining is mixed with saltpetre and melted, when a button of
pure gold will be found in the crucible. Quartz ores should yield $6 to
the ton in order to pay.</p>

<p>To test pyrites for gold, reduce a given quantity to powder and wash as
before; then roast the residue at a red heat. Upon cooling, add
quicksilver and treat as just<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_097" id="page_097"></a>{97}</span> described. Pyrites should yield $1 of
gold to the bushel of ore to be profitable.</p>

<p>Native silver often contains gold. To separate them, carefully flatten
the alloy with a smooth hammer on an anvil, and then boil it in strong
nitric acid in a glass flask for about ten minutes. Carefully pour off
the acid into a vial, and wash the powder in the flask (which is fine
gold) with water and dry. To the liquid in the vial add a solution of
common salt. The white powder which falls should be removed, washed with
water, and fused with powdered chalk or iron filings; a button of pure
silver is the result.</p>

<p>Any substance supposed to be or to contain gold may be tested by
dissolving it powdered in aqua regia and then pouring in a solution of
copperas; if there is gold, the reddish-brown precipitate, by rubbing,
assumes a bright metallic lustre.</p>

<p>To tell whether a globule of silver has any gold in it, put it on a
white porcelain dish and moisten it with a drop of nitric<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_098" id="page_098"></a>{98}</span> acid: if it
is pure silver, it will dissolve and retain its white color; if mixed
with gold, it will soon turn gray or black.</p>

<p>To test the purity of gold, rub some of it off on a hard black flint
slate, and apply to the mark a drop of aqua fortis. If the gold is pure,
the yellow streak remains unchanged, but if alloyed it partly
disappears; if it is only an imitation of gold, it vanishes altogether.</p>

<p>A ready method of finding the amount of gold in a quartz rock with
considerable accuracy, is by taking the specific gravity of the rock
(well cleaned) as given on page 13. If the gravity is not over 2.7, it
contains little or no gold. If it is 3, it very likely is gold-bearing,
although pyrites may be present. But if it is over 5, it is undoubtedly
auriferous, and if 12, it is very rich in gold.</p>

<p>It is generally considered that the sand of any river is worth working
for the gold it contains, provided it will yield twenty-four grains to
the hundred weight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_099" id="page_099"></a>{99}</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Assay of Silver Ore.</span>&mdash;Pure silver is easily recognized. But lead and
copper ores often contain a large percentage of the precious metal.</p>

<p>To detect silver in lead ore, dissolve the powdered ore in strong nitric
acid; pour off the liquid and insert a piece of pure copper. If silver
is present, it will go to the bottom. Or, add to the liquid a solution
of common salt, and it will instantly become cloudy or white. If lead
ore yields three ounces of silver to a ton, it may be worked for the
silver as well as the lead. In Colorado, the average value of
silver-bearing galena is $100 per ton.</p>

<p>To test the copper ores for silver, dissolve them in nitric acid; then
add a few drops of muriatic acid, and if silver is present, a white
curdy precipitate will fall to the bottom. Native copper, when polished,
often shows white spots of silver.</p>

<p>To estimate the proportion of silver in lead ore, reduce a known
quantity of the clear ore to powder, mix with a little dry<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_100" id="page_100"></a>{100}</span> soda and a
few nails, and heat in a round-bottomed iron pot or crucible. The lead
which is obtained should then be put in a cup having ashes at the
bottom, and strongly heated in an open furnace. A globule of silver will
be left, if any is present, and being weighed, the percentage can be
found.</p>

<p>Rich silver ores may be reduced by mixing them with ten parts of common
salt, and exposing the mass for hours in an open furnace, stirring it
frequently. When cold reduce to powder and mix with an equal quantity of
quicksilver and enough water to make a paste, and agitate the mixture
for two days, when the amalgam will fall to the bottom. The amalgam is
then squeezed in a leather bag and washed.</p>

<p>Silver glance will yield its metal by heating it before a blow-pipe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Assay of Copper Ore.</span>&mdash;When the ore is native copper and rock, as at Lake
Superior, it should be pounded and the earthy matter washed away. Then
mix<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_101" id="page_101"></a>{101}</span> with a little potash or soda and bring to a high heat in a
crucible.</p>

<p>Other copper ores may be tested by dissolving them powdered in dilute
aqua regia. The presence of silver will be shown by a white powder on
the bottom. Then add considerable ammonia. If there is any copper a blue
liquor will be produced. Strain this through tissue paper, and evaporate
to dryness. Dissolve the residue in muriatic acid, and by putting in a
piece of iron or zinc, the copper will fall down. Or, add to this
solution pure potash; dry and weigh the powder thrown down; every 5
parts of it contains 4 parts of copper.</p>

<p>Gray copper and red copper ores may be assayed by heating with charcoal,
(both powdered,) in a furnace. Malachite and azurite should be smelted
with borax; Copper pyrites and silicate of copper with soda or powdered
marble.</p>

<p>A ton of copper ore which contains ten per cent. of metal, pays $25 at
the furnace. The ore of copper when roasted, turns<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_102" id="page_102"></a>{102}</span> black; and when
thrown into nitric acid makes a sky-blue solution. A clean knife-blade
put into this solution will be coated with copper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Assay of Iron Ore.</span>&mdash;Take a known quantity of the ore in fine powder and
mix thoroughly with dry borax (or with one part of fluor spar, one of
charcoal and four of salt,) and expose it for an hour in a covered
crucible lined with charcoal to a white heat in a wind-furnace for an
hour. A button of iron will be found at the bottom, which determines the
percentage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Assay of Zinc Ore.</span>&mdash;If the weighed ore is roasted with powdered
charcoal, white flowers of zinc will be formed on a piece of cold iron
held over it. After thorough roasting, the residue should be weighed;
the loss is the oxide of zinc, and every 100 parts of this contain 81 of
metal.</p>

<p>All the ores of zinc will dissolve in either nitric or hot sulphuric
acid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Assay of Tin Ore.</span>&mdash;Tin-stone will<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_103" id="page_103"></a>{103}</span> yield up its metal if mixed with
charcoal, borax and soda, and heated on the hearth of a furnace or
before a blow-pipe.</p>

<p>The presence of tin may be tested by dissolving the metal thus roasted
out, in aqua regia and adding a decoction of Brazil-wood: if the metal
was tin, the liquid will be colored a beautiful crimson.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Assay of Lead Ore.</span>&mdash;Both galena and cerussite are rich ores, and when
abundant pay well. They are easily reduced by heat, the former being
usually mixed with charcoal and iron filings. If a western backwoodsman
wants shot or bullets, he kindles a fire in a hollow tree or an old
stump, puts some galena on the charred wood, and melts it down. After
cooling, he finds the metal at the bottom. The smelting of a ton of lead
costs about $6. The average price per ton of galena is $30. When galena
is dissolved in warm nitric acid, a clean plate of zinc placed in it
will be coated with brilliant blades of lead; if the galena contains
silver, a plate<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_104" id="page_104"></a>{104}</span> of copper will be served in the same way. A solution of
chromate of potash poured into a solution of lead ore in nitric acid
will throw down a yellow powder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To Test the Purity of Graphite.</span>&mdash;Its value depends upon the amount of
its carbon. Pulverize and then dry at a heat of about 350 degrees,
twenty grains of it; then place it in a tube of hard glass four or five
inches long, half an inch wide and closed at one end. Add twenty times
as much well dried oxide of lead and well mix. Weigh the tube and
contents, and afterwards heat before a blow-pipe till the contents are
completely fused and no longer evolve gases. Ten minutes will suffice
for this. Allow the tube to cool and weigh it. The loss in weight is
carbonic acid. For every twenty-eight parts of loss there must have been
twelve of carbon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_105" id="page_105"></a>{105}</span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">A</span>NY spring which contains a large amount of foreign matter, as gas,
salts and earthy ingredients, is called <i>mineral water</i>. The special
prominence of any ingredient gives it its particular name. Many iron
springs contain salt, salt springs contain iron, and both may contain
gas; the name is derived from the most prominent ingredient.</p>

<p>Our country is rich in mineral springs; there is not a State without
one. But in general they are most numerous in hilly or mountainous
regions, especially where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_106" id="page_106"></a>{106}</span> rocks are much deranged in position, or
“faulted,” as the miners say. As for example, in Eastern New York and in
the valley between the Blue Ridge and the Alleghany from Harper’s Ferry
to the Natural Bridge. The Pacific States, also, are as remarkable for
the number and variety of their mineral springs as for their metallic
ores.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carbonated or Gas Springs.</span>&mdash;Springs of this class have a peculiar
sparkling character and are continually sending up bubbles of gas. When
the quantity of gas is small, it may be detected by adding a little lime
water which will give it a milky appearance and deposit a white
sediment; or, dip in a piece of blue litmus paper (which can be had of
most druggists), and if there is any carbonic acid gas in the water, it
will be reddened; or, pour in a little vinegar, stir well, and then add
a little finely powdered sugar, when the gas, if it is there, will rise
in small bubbles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_107" id="page_107"></a>{107}</span></p>

<p>The most celebrated carbonated springs are the following: Saratoga and
Ballston, N. Y.; Clarendon, Vt.; Sweet Springs in Shover’s Valley, Pa.;
Bladon and Bailey Springs, Ala.; “Boiling Springs” near Pike’s Peak,
Col.; Beer Springs near Bear River, Or. These springs contain salt,
soda, magnesia, lime and iron, and are sometimes classed as <i>saline</i>,
<i>soda</i> or <i>chalybeate</i> springs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chalybeate or Iron Springs.</span>&mdash;The presence of iron in a spring may be
ascertained by pouring into it an infusion of nut-galls, of logwood or
of tan-bark, which will change it immediately to a black or dark color.
If the water contains much iron, it may be recognized by its inky taste
and by a yellowish powder on the border of the spring or at the bottom
of a tumbler when allowed to stand awhile.</p>

<p>If waters have a cool but earthy taste, they contain lime; if bitter,
they have magnesia. The “soda springs,” so called,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_108" id="page_108"></a>{108}</span> are often only
saline, carbonated or magnesia waters.</p>

<p>The most famous iron springs are at Saratoga, Sandlake and Catskill, N.
Y.; West Bethel, Fryeburg, Eberne and Bethel, Me.; Schooley’s Mountain
in Washington, N. J.; Bedford, Pittsburg, Frankfort and York, Pa.;
Brandywine Springs, Del.; Red Sweet Springs in Monroe County, Rawley’s
Spring in Rockingham County, and Huguenot Springs in Powhattan County,
Va.; in Bath County, Ky.; Yellow Springs, O.; twenty miles east of
Knoxville, Tenn.; Madison County, Geo.; Raymond and Lynchburg, Miss.;
near Ogden City, Utah; near Mt. Shasta, Col.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sulphur Springs.</span>&mdash;These are easily recognized by their unpleasant odor,
resembling that of rotten eggs. The water blackens silver and a solution
of sugar of lead.</p>

<p>Sulphur springs are very numerous. The best known are at Saratoga,
Sharon, Clifton, Avon, Manlius, Chittenango, Dryden<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_109" id="page_109"></a>{109}</span> and Richfield, N.
Y.; Highgate and Newburg, Vt.; Togus, Bethel and West Newfield, Me.;
Shover’s Valley, Carlisle and Doubling Gap, Pa.; Winchester and
Warrenton, Va.; Greenbrier and Monroe Counties, W. Va.; Bath County,
Ky.; White’s Creek near Nashville and in Granger County, Tenn.;
Spartanburg, S. C.; Butts County, Geo.; Tallahatta, Ala.; Tampa, Fla.;
near Bitter Creek and Great Salt Lake, Utah; along the Yellowstone
River, Mont.; Jackson, Cal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Acid or Alum Springs.</span>&mdash;These waters have a more or less sour taste and
redden blue litmus-paper.</p>

<p>They are found at Byron and Oak Orchard, N. Y.; Blossburg, Pa.; Bath,
Richmond and Rockbridge, Va.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Magnesian or Epsom Springs.</span>&mdash;These have a bitter taste. To test any
water for magnesia, add to a glass of it a solution of phosphate of soda
and some hartshorn; if magnesia is present, the liquid first becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_110" id="page_110"></a>{110}</span>
turbid, and finally minute crystals fall to the bottom.</p>

<p>There are Epsom springs at Harrodsburg and Perryville, Ky.; Westport,
O.; Raymond, Miss.; Orange County, Ind.; Scott County, W. Va.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Saline or Salt Springs.</span>&mdash;These contain a large percentage of common
salt, and are recognized by their taste. They generally contain many
ingredients, (generally seven or eight,) but the salt predominates. A
well should contain at least ten per cent. of salt to pay for working.
The Syracuse spring yields a bushel of salt to every thirty-three
gallons; while the Great Salt Lake contains 22 per cent. Among the most
important salt wells are those at Syracuse, Salina and Liverpool, N. Y.;
Lubec, Me.; Shannondale, Va.; Bath County, Ky.; Athens County, O.;
Hartford, Ind.; Saginaw, Mich.; Oneida, Idaho.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thermal or Warm Springs.</span>&mdash;Any spring is so called, the temperature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_111" id="page_111"></a>{111}</span>
which throughout the year is above that of the soil around it. They
generally occur near the line of junction between the granite or igneous
rocks and the stratified rock (slate or limestone) resting upon its
flanks. The temperature of such waters in the United States ranges from
73 to 200 degrees, the latter being reached by the Geysers of Montana.
Many iron and sulphur springs are also thermal.</p>

<p>The most noted warm springs are at Lebanon, N. Y.; in Bath, Berkley,
Monroe and Scott Counties, Va.; Buncombe Counties, N. C.; French Brood
River, Tenn.; Meriwether County, Geo.; Washitaw, Ark.; Salt Lake Valley,
Utah; near Pyramid Lake, Nev.; along the Malheur and Fall Rivers, Or.;
Lincoln Valley, Idaho; on Gardiner’s River, in Madison County, and
especially in the Yellowstone Basin, Mont.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Artesian Wells.</span>&mdash;To sink a flowing well with any reasonable prospect of
success, it is essential that the spot selected<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_112" id="page_112"></a>{112}</span> should be lower than
land in the vicinity, although those higher elevations may be several
miles away. The layers of the rocks, also, should dip <i>towards</i> the spot
rather than away from it. The best indication, but not a certain one, is
a <i>great</i> basin-shaped valley, to the centre of which the rocks dip on
one or more sides. Sandy, lime and slate rocks are more propitious than

<p><span class="smcap">Oil Wells.</span>&mdash;Where there are marks of disturbance and misplacement of the
rocks, there the experienced sink wells. Rugged hills and
sharply-defined valleys are, generally, signs of such dislocation. The
line or “break” from which the rocks dip like the roof of a house is
considered most favorable. There is no such thing as an “oil rock,” for
the oil is found at different depths, and the fissure containing it is
more or less vertical. In Pennsylvania, the greatest flowing wells have
been found in the third sand rock. No limestone has afforded any large
supply of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_113" id="page_113"></a>{113}</span> oil. Coal in no large quantities is ever found upon or in the
immediate vicinity of the oil territory. The “show of oil” increases in
value as a sign, with the depth at which it is found. Especially is the
finding of a large amount of imprisoned gas, though no oil may be
present, regarded as a good indication that oil is near. In the
bituminous coal region, a gas spring indicates the probable existence of
oil in the rocks below. But generally, “surface shows” are seductive.
The great oil belt runs south-westerly from Oil Creek, Pa., to Burning
Springs, West Va. But Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama,
Missouri, Texas, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Southern California are
also rich in petroleum.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_114" id="page_114"></a>{114}</span></p>

GOLD&mdash;LIST OF PRECIOUS STONES.</p></div>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">“B</span>RISTOL Stones,” “Irish Diamonds,” “Cape May Diamonds,” and “California
Diamonds,” are skillfully-cut quartz crystals. They are easily detected
by the file and by their lightness.</p>

<p>“Paris Brilliants” are more dangerous counterfeits, and are very often
sold for genuine. The great establishment of Boarguiguon, in Paris, is
the most famous manufactory of artificial gems in the world, employing
about one hundred hands. The gems are such perfect imitations that they
can be distinguished from real<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_115" id="page_115"></a>{115}</span> stones only by the closest scrutiny of
those experienced in such matters. They fail chiefly in hardness; in
brilliancy and gravity they nearly or quite equal the genuine.</p>

<p>Nature has made the most precious stones with the most common materials.
The diamond is purified charcoal; while the matter of clay and white
pebbles is the base of all other gems.</p>

<p>The chemist has imitated nature in the production of colored gems. The
base of these imitations, called “pastes,” is “<i>strass</i>”&mdash;a white glass
compound of 300 parts of pure sand, 96 of potash, 27 of borax, 514 of
white lead, and one of arsenic. The mixture is put into a crucible and
kept at a high heat for 24 hours. This is the philosopher’s stone which
competes with Golconda. The uncolored glass is used in making mock
diamonds and white topaz. Another paste which has very great brilliancy,
and, unfortunately, the same gravity as the diamond, is made by melting
100 parts of pure sand, 150 of red lead, 30<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_116" id="page_116"></a>{116}</span> of calcined potash, 10 of
calcined borax and one of arsenic, keeping the mixture melted for two or
three days and then cooling very slowly. Each ingredient is separately
reduced to a fine powder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">False Ruby</span> is made by fusing together of strass one ounce and six drams,
glass of antimony 37 grains, and purple of cassius one grain; then add
eight parts more of strass and fuse for thirty hours; cool and remelt
pieces in a blow-pipe. Or, melt five ounces of strass and one dram of
manganese.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">False Topaz</span> can be made from 1008 grains of strass, 43 grains of glass
of antimony and one grain of purple of cassius.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">False Sapphire.</span>&mdash;Add to eight ounces of strass 52 grains of pure oxide
of cobalt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">False Emerald.</span>&mdash;To one pound of strass add one dram of verdigris and
fifteen grains of crocus martis. Or, take 2304 grains of strass, 21
grains of green oxide of copper, and one grain of oxide of chrome. Or,
take an ounce and a half<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_117" id="page_117"></a>{117}</span> of rock-crystal, six drams of dry soda, two
drams of dry borax, two drams of red lead, one dram of nitre, twenty
grains of red oxide of iron, and ten grains of green carbonate of
copper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">False Carnelian.</span>&mdash;Strass two pounds, glass of antimony one pound, rouge
two ounces, manganese one dram.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">False Amethysts and Opals</span> are manufactured; but the fine opal defies
imitation, and the amethyst is too common in nature to allow much margin
for the “pastes.”</p>

<p>In distinguishing true and false gems, no one character should be
depended upon. All genuine stones will bear rough handling; if the
merchant says “hands off,” refuse to purchase. Any gem worth buying is
worth testing.</p>

<p>First: try the <i>hardness</i>. The file will make no impression on the
diamond and ruby, and will with difficulty scratch the other gems; while
the “pastes” are easily marred. All the precious stones scratch<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_118" id="page_118"></a>{118}</span> window
glass, although opal will not attack common bottle glass. All imitations
easily yield to sand. The sapphire is the hardest of colored gems, and
opal is the softest. The emerald will hardly scratch rock-crystal; its
counterfeit not at all. Topaz will scratch ordinary ruby, but will not
touch sapphire.</p>

<p>Secondly: as to <i>weight</i>. This is the most accurate method, but the
stone must be taken from its setting. The mode of taking the gravity has
already been given (page 13), and the amount of each is stated in
Chapter II. Garnet is the heaviest of gems; weighed in water it loses
only one-fourth of its weight; <i>i. e.</i>, if a red garnet be suspended by
a fine thread from a delicate balance and immersed in a glass of water
under it, one-quarter of its ordinary weight in air must be added to the
pan from which it is suspended to restore the equilibrium. In like
manner, ruby and sapphire lose a little more. The diamond and white
topaz lose two-sevenths<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_119" id="page_119"></a>{119}</span> of their weight. Rock-crystal, amethyst,
carnelian and agate lose five-thirteenths; and opal about one-half,
being the lightest of gems. The emerald loses more than one-third.</p>

<p>As “paste” <i>can</i> be made so as to have the same specific gravity as the
genuine article, this test alone can not be relied upon; but very few of
the imitations are so carefully made. The test is very convenient in
distinguishing gems of like color from each other, as oriental ruby,
spinel ruby and red tourmaline, and green tourmaline and emerald.</p>

<p>Thirdly: characteristics depending on <i>light</i> and <i>electricity</i>. It is
not easy to look through a diamond of the first water, while imitations
readily permit objects to be seen through them. A very delicate and
perfect test of a diamond, distinguishing it from all colorless gems, as
white topaz, white sapphire and white zircon, but not from “pastes,” is
to look through it at a pin-hole in a card. This requires some
dexterity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_120" id="page_120"></a>{120}</span> and the gem should be fixed to a steady object by a bit of
wax at a proper distance. A true diamond will show but one hole, all the
others will show two. As white topaz, when large, is a magnificent
stone, it is often palmed off for a diamond of great value; but this
test is invariably certain.</p>

<p>A true diamond retains its brilliancy under water.</p>

<p>When a colored stone is placed in the path of the solar spectrum (the
row of seven colors into which sunlight is separated by a prism), its
color will vary with the portion of the spectrum which falls upon it;
and two stones of the same color, but of a different nature, will
exhibit different effects. Thus, a paste placed beside a fine colored
gem, betrays its worthlessness. A simpler method of testing stones is to
look at them through a bit of glass, colored red, yellow, blue or green.
Every stone will exhibit, under this test, properties peculiar to
itself, and by which its<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_121" id="page_121"></a>{121}</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_123" id="page_123"></a>{123}</span></p>

<p class="nind">nature may be recognized. This is also a severe test for the purity of
tint; for if pure and unmixed, the stone will appear completely black in
every other light but its own color. Milky and turbid stones can not
bear this test.</p>

<p>A first-class ruby has the color of the blood as it spirts from an
artery. The deeper the hue of the emerald the more it is valued; it
loses none of its brilliancy by artificial light. The pale rose topaz,
the kind most esteemed, is artificially colored by heating it.</p>

<p>If topaz or tourmaline be gently heated, it becomes electric and will
attract a thread or suspended pith-ball. No imitation will do this. All
real gems when rubbed will attract the pith-ball, and retain the power a
long time; the pastes also become electric, but soon lose their
attraction. Rub a glass tube with a piece of flannel and bring it near a
suspended pith-ball; the latter will be strongly attracted and then
repelled. Immediately rub a genuine diamond<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_124" id="page_124"></a>{124}</span> and bring it near the ball,
and it will be attracted. A paste diamond thus rubbed would repel it.</p>

<p>Finally: the breath remains much longer on the pastes than on real gems.
The former also betray under a magnifying glass small air bubbles.
Diamonds and other first-class stones are always cold to the touch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">False Pearls.</span>&mdash;These are glass beads coated with a mixture of three
ounces of scales of the blay or bleak fish, half an ounce of fine glue,
one ounce of white wax and one ounce of pulverized alabaster. Powdered
opal is sometimes used; also the powdered pearl of the oyster and other
shells soaked in vinegar, and made up with gum tragacanth. Artificial
pearls are usually brittle, and do not weigh more than two-thirds as
much as the genuine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">False Corals.</span>&mdash;These are made of resin and vermilion; or of marble
powder made into a paste with varnish or soluble glass and a little
isinglass, colored by Chinese<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_125" id="page_125"></a>{125}</span> vermilion, and then moulded. They are
used for setting in cheap jewelry. The knife shows it to be too soft to
be genuine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Artificial Gold.</span>&mdash;The following oroid or imitation gold is sometimes
sold for the genuine article which it closely resembles. Pure copper,
100 parts by weight, is melted in a crucible, and then 6 parts of
magnesia, 3.6 of sal-ammoniac, 1.8 of quicklime and 9. of tartar are
added separately and gradually in the form of powder. The whole is then
stirred for about half an hour, and 17 parts of zinc or tin in small
grains are thrown in and thoroughly mixed. The crucible is now covered
and the mixture kept melted for half an hour longer, when it is skimmed
and poured out.</p>

<p>Any imitation of gold may be detected by its weight, which is not
one-half of what it should be, and by its dissolving in nitric acid
while pure gold is untouched.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_126" id="page_126"></a>{126}</span></p>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span>T was on the 19th day of January, 1848, that James W. Marshall, while
engaged in digging a race for a saw-mill at Coloma, about thirty-five
miles eastward from Sutter’s Fort, found some pieces of yellow metal,
which he and the half-dozen men working with him at the mill supposed to
be gold. He felt confident that he had made a discovery of great
importance, but he knew nothing of either chemistry or gold-mining, so
he could not prove the nature of the metal nor tell how to obtain it in
paying quantities. Every morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_128" id="page_128"></a>{128}</span> he went down to the race to look for
the bits of the metal; but the other men at the mill thought Marshall
was very wild in his ideas, and they continued their labors in building
the mill, and in sowing wheat and planting vegetables. The swift current
of the mill-race washed away a considerable body of earthy matter,
leaving the coarse particles of gold behind; so Marshall’s collection of
specimens continued to accumulate, and his associates began to think
there might be something in his gold mines after all. About the middle
of February, a Mr. Bennet, one of the party employed at the mill, went
to San Francisco for the purpose of learning whether this metal was
precious, and there he was introduced to Isaac Humphrey, who had washed
for gold in Georgia. The experienced miner saw at a glance that he had
the true stuff before him, and, after a few inquiries, he was satisfied
that the diggings must be rich. He made immediate preparation to go to
the mill, and tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_129" id="page_129"></a>{129}</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page_131" id="page_131"></a>{131}</span></p>

<p class="nind">to persuade some of his friends to go with him; but they thought it
would be only a waste of time and money, so he went with Bennet for his
sole companion.</p>

<p>He arrived at Coloma on the 7th of March, and found the work at the mill
going on as if no gold existed in the neighborhood. The next day he took
a pan and spade, and washed some of the dirt in the bottom of the
mill-race in places where Marshall had found his specimens, and, in a
few hours, Humphrey declared that these mines were far richer than any
in Georgia. He now made a rocker and went to work washing gold
industriously, and every day yielded to him an ounce or two of metal.
The men at the mill made rockers for themselves, and all were soon busy
in search of the yellow metal. Everything else was abandoned; the rumor
of the discovery spread slowly. In the middle of March Pearson B.
Reading, the owner of a large ranch at the head of the Sacramento
valley, happened to visit Sutter’s Fort, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_132" id="page_132"></a>{132}</span> hearing of the mining at
Coloma, he went thither to see it. He said that if similarity of
formation could be taken as a proof, there must be gold-mines near his
ranch; so, after observing the method of washing, he posted off, and in
a few weeks he was at work on the bars of Clear Creek, nearly two
hundred miles north-westward from Coloma. A few days after Reading had
left, John Bidwell, now representative of the northern district of the
State in the lower House of Congress, came to Coloma, and the result of
his visit was that, in less than a month, he had a party of Indians from
his ranch washing gold on the bars of Feather River, twenty-five miles
north-westward from Coloma. Thus the mines were opened at far distant
points.</p>

<p>The first printed notice of the discovery of gold, was given in the
California newspaper published in San Francisco on the 15th of March. On
the 29th of May the same paper, announcing that its publication would be
suspended, says:&mdash;“The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_133" id="page_133"></a>{133}</span> whole country, from San Francisco to Los
Angelos, and from the sea-shore to the base of the Sierra Nevada,
resound with the sordid cry of <i>gold! gold! gold!</i> while the field is
left half planted, the house half built, and everything neglected but
the manufacture of picks and shovels, and the means of transportation to
the spot where one man obtained one hundred and twenty-eight dollars’
worth of the real stuff in one day’s washing; and the average for all
concerned, is twenty dollars per diem.”</p>

<p>The first to commence quartz mining in California were Capt. Wm. Jackson
and Mr. Eliason, both Virginians, and the first machine used was a
Chilian mill.</p>

<p>The Reid Mine, in North Carolina, was the first gold mine discovered and
worked in the United States, and the only one in North America from
which, up to 1825, gold was sent to the Mint.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_134" id="page_134"></a>{134}</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>DISCOVERY OF SILVER IN NEVADA, AND UNITED STATES GOLD AND SILVER
STATISTICS.</p></div>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">S</span>EPARATED from California by the snowy chain of the Sierra, the State of
Nevada has been celebrated, since 1860, for its silver mining. In
November, 1859, the news of the discovery of silver mines near Lake
Washoe was confirmed at San Francisco; and in June, 1860, the mines of
Washoe, the central western portion of the State, had already sent such
rich results to Europe, that the French Ministers of Finance and
Commerce despatched a mining engineer to Nevada to make a close
inspection of these wonderful mines. It seemed as if the world were
about to be inundated with silver, as it had been by gold ten years
previously; and what would<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_135" id="page_135"></a>{135}</span> those economists now say, who had only
recently counselled that the value of gold coin should be lowered or
that gold should be demonetized on account of the disturbed relation of
these precious metals&mdash;the bases of the standard of payment throughout
the world generally. Whilst the French engineer visited Nevada and
prepared his report, the miners of Washoe continued working their veins
of metal. At the present time, 1881, the mines on the eastern slope of
the Sierra Nevada annually produce about $12,500,000 of silver, chiefly
from the Comstock lode; the total yield of gold from the quartz mines of
California is about $17,000,000 per annum. The Comstock lode, in the
State of Nevada, may be ranked among the most productive metalliferous
deposits ever encountered in the history of mining enterprise; its
productive capacity, as now being developed, surpassing, if the mass of
its ores do not in richness equal, those of the most famous mines of
Mexico and Peru.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_136" id="page_136"></a>{136}</span></p>

<p>The known limits of this lode cover a space of 22,546 feet in a nearly
due north and south direction (magnetic). The variation of the needle in
that locality is 16½ degrees east. Upon this extensive seat of
metalliferous deposits, the mines are divided into three groups: the
Virginia Group, seventeen mines, with claims of 13,549⅓ feet; Gold
Hill Group, nine mines, of 6,397¼ feet; American Flat Group, three
mines, of 2,600 feet. The three groups of twenty-nine mines thus occupy
a total length on the lode of 22,546 feet. The Comstock lode was
discovered in 1859, by a pit sunk for a water hole on the ground of the
Ophir mine; milling the ore began in October of the same year, but the
amount of bullion taken out in 1860 is estimated at but $100,000. Since
then the Comstock has become the greatest gold and silver mine in the
world. To the end of 1878 the yield was estimated at $291,162,205, as
follows: From 1860 to 1870 inclusive, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_137" id="page_137"></a>{137}</span> gold and silver together,
unclassified, $102,466,240; 1871 to 1878 inclusive, gold, $88,691,498,
silver, $91,278,623; 1877 and 1878, gold and silver, unclassified,
$1,725,844. Making allowance for the loss by slimes and tailings, the
gross contents of the lode as worked up to 1878 are estimated at
$363,961,205. About 6,500,000 tons of ore have been extracted in this
time, which a good authority estimates of an average value to the
company of $45 per ton of 2,000 pounds.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
